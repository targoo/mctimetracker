# Step 1: Get the Code
[Download](http://www.openvbx.org/download) the latest release and unpack the source code into your webroot.

OpenVBX needs a database from either your hosting provider or your own web server.  Please see your hosting provider's documentation on creating databases for more info.

# Step 3: Run the Installer
Open your web browser and navigate to the URL of your OpenVBX installation. The installer will check that your system meets the minimum requirements and will configure your new phone system. You may have to adjust the permissions on the OpenVBX upload and configuration directories.

During the install process, you will be prompted for your Twilio API credentials. You can obtain your _Account SID_ and _Auth Token_ from your [Twilio Dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/). You must be logged into your Twilio account to access the dashboard. If you don't have a Twilio account [register for a free trial](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) and we'll include $30.00 worth of credit to help you get started.

# Step 5: Login
Navigate to the URL of your OpenVBX installation and login using the account you created during the installation. Once you're logged in you'll be able to add users and groups to your new phone system. You can also add devices, provision phone numbers, configure voicemail, and design call flows.

OpenVBX Step by Step Explanation

# About
This page provides detailed information for each step of the OpenVBX install process.

# OpenVBX Server Check
OpenVBX requires the software listed below. It is all available for free and is open source. OpenVBX is supported and should run on all major linux distributions. OpenVBX may run on other platforms (namely Windows) but is currently unsupported.

1. PHP version
 * We recommend PHP 5.2 or higher, although you can get away with earlier versions as long as you have [PEAR Services_JSON](http://pear.php.net/package/Services_JSON) installed
1. CURL support
 * OpenVBX requires CURL. If you don't meet this requirement, install the CURL module.
1. Apache version
 * We recommend Apache version 2.2+. Earlier versions and other web servers may work, but are currently unsupported.
1. MySQL support
 * We require MySQL version 5+.
1. APC support (optional)
 * APC is recommended, but not required.
1. Config directory writable
 * The configuration directory must be writable by the user your webserver is running as for the OpenVBX installation to complete. The path to the configuration directory is '<webroot>/OpenVBX/config'. On unix systems you can adjust the permissions with the `chown` and `chmod` commands.
1. SimpleXML support
 * OpenVBX requires SimpleXML. If you don't meet this requirement, install the SimpleXML module.
1. JSON support
 * OpenVBX requires JSON. If you don't meet this requirement, install the JSON module. For versions of PHP prior to 5.2 you will need the [PEAR Services_JSON](http://pear.php.net/package/Services_JSON) PECL module installed.
1. Upload directory writable
 * The upload directory must be writable by the user your webserver is running as for the OpenVBX installation to complete. The path to the configuration directory is '<webroot>/OpenVBX/audio-uploads'. On unix systems you can adjust the permissions with the `chown` and `chmod` commands.

# Configure Database
OpenVBX requires a MySQL database. You should create a database, and a user with permissions to access the database for OpenVBX. If you are running OpenVBX on a shared hosting environment, you may have to use the tools provided by your hosting provider to create a new database and database user.

1. Hostname
 * In most cases this should be 'localhost'. If your database server is on a machine other than your webserver, specify it's address here.
1. Username
 * The username to use when connecting to MySQL
1. Password
 * The password to use when connecting to MySQL
1. Database Name
 * The name of your OpenVBX database.

# Connect to your Twilio account
